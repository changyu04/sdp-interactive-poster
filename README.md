## Launching the poster

To launch the poster, load the project into a suitable environment for JS and JSX (eg. vscode) and ensure you have node.js and react.js installed:
````bash
npm install -g npm
npm i react
````
Then, start the project: 
```bash
npm start
```
The poster should launch on your internet browser, running locally. It should display the home page by default, but if not, click on the 'Home' or the NUS/SCB logo on the left to access the home page. 

As the project utilises packages such as flexbox, boostrap etc, there may be errors if you do not have these packages installed. Kindly install the packages using the following code snippets and rerun the project
````bash
npm install react-flexbox --save
npm i react-bootstrap
````
In the future, should this page be launched on the internet, the link will be updated here.
